# ⚙️PyCoGSS: Getting started with landscape analysis in Python⚙️
*A compact introduction to wrangling and visualizing large geospatial datasets - minimal previous Python knowledge required!*

## Research goals and learning objectives:

My **research goals** for my students are to feel excited and empowered to:
- Query existing sources of environmental and geomorphic data to *form* hypotheses of how Earth's surface works
- Thoughtfully collect new datasets from remotely sensed products to *test* those hypotheses

**Learning objectives** to achieve these goals are:

- Build confidence executing code and navigating to files and directories within a Jupyter Notebook 
- Gain familiarity and comfort working with numerical data in Python through `numpy` and basic querying and analysis of tabular data with `pandas` (aka WRANGLIN')
- Build basic data visualizations with `matplotlib`, as well as visualizing more complex datasets with `pandas` built-in plotting as well as with the `seaborn` plotting package
- Load, generate, and spatially query data with geospatial properties with `geopandas`
- Perform complex data queries over large `pandas` datasets and save results to external files

## Installation
*For W&M research students; in progress*

## Optional content before, during, and after this course

### Before
Not sure you're comfortable with Python? (or Git? or bash?). CU Boulder [EarthLab]() is a resource for analyzing Earth data with open-source Python and would make an excellent companion to the material in this course. Their [Introduction to Earth Data Science](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/intro-to-earth-data-science/) textbook goes over most of the basics of Python, version control with `git`, and common packages like `numpy` and `pandas`. 

After you work through this course you might want to review their [Earth Analytics Python Course](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/earth-analytics-python//), which has overlap with the material in this repo. 

## During
There are, in fact, myriad resources for learning to work with geospatial data in Python. A non-exhaustive list is here:
- [Geocomputation with Python](https://py.geocompx.org/) textbook, which can be run in GitHub Codespaces. 

### After
Ready to supercharge your work with geospatial data? 
- EarthLab explores a wide variety of remote sensing data structures in [this course](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/use-data-open-source-python/)
- Learn parts of the [Pangeo stack](https://pangeo.io/architecture.html) (`dask`, `xarray`, `intake`, and `geopandas`) with [these notebooks](https://gallery.pangeo.io/repos/pangeo-data/pangeo-tutorial-gallery/index.html)
